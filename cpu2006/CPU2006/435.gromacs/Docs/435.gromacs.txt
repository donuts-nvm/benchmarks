Benchmark Program General Category

   Chemistry / Molecular Dynamics

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark Description

   435.gromacs is derived from GROMACS, a versatile package that performs
   molecular dynamics, i.e. simulation of the Newtonian equations of motion
   for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.

   Although it is primarily designed for biochemical molecules such as
   proteins and lipids that have many complicated bonded interactions,
   GROMACS is also extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions
   (that usually dominate the simulation cost). Therefore, many groups are
   also using it for research on non-biological systems, such as polymers.

   The benchmark version performs a simulation of the protein Lysozyme in a
   solution of water and ions. The structure of a protein is normally
   determined by experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography of NMR
   spectroscopy. By simulating the atomic motions of these structures, one
   can gain significant understanding of protein dynamics and function, and,
   in some cases, it might even be possible to predict the structure of new
   proteins.

   A dodecahedron-shaped box is used to reduce the amount of solvent water,
   but there are still 23179 atoms in the system. The simulation time is
   completely dominated by the inner loops where the nonbonded Lennard-Jones
   and Coulomb interactions are calculated between atoms that are closer than
   1.4 nm in space.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   There are three different run input files with identical setup, but a
   different number of steps taken.

     * test 1500 steps
     * train 3000 steps
     * ref 6000 steps

   Once the code is compiled the SPEC harness invokes the benchmark with a
   command such as:

 gromacs -nice 0 -deffnm gromacs -silent

   The -deffnm option uses the name provided for the base of all input and
   output files (in this case "gromacs"): gromacs.tpr is the input file and
   gromacs.out is the output file. The nice flag has no effect on Windows,
   but on Unix the program defaults to nice 19 if it is not given. The
   -silent option turns off producing a log file.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   For validation a couple of energy terms are written in clear text to the
   file gromacs.out. These are the average potential energy, the average
   system temperature, and the number of floating point operations performed.

   Molecular dynamics is by definition a chaotic process. Normally, quite
   agressive compiler optimizations are used to compile the code, hence
   slight variations are quite normal. The gromacs.out results shouldn't
   differ by more than 1.25% from the reference values.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   C and Fortran. The only Fortran code is the inner loops (innerf.f). The
   inner loops typically account for more than 95% of the runtime, so all the
   computationally intensive parts use Fortran.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

   If a Fortran compiler does not append an underscore to external names, the
   flag -DSPEC_CPU_APPEND_UNDERSCORE can be used to change the name mangling
   macro in config.h.

   SPEC has chosen some settings in config.h to select whether one's C
   compiler supports strdup(), strcasecmp(), popen()/pclose(), or if it lacks
   some ANSI C keywords like 'const'. None of these will affect performance,
   but it makes the benchmark compatible with standard Gromacs input/output
   files. If a compiler should come along that is incompatible with SPEC's
   settings in config.h, SPEC should be notified (see [1]techsupport.html).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portability issues fixed subsequent to the release of SPEC CPU2006 V1.0

   For CPU2006 V1.1:

     * Internal system calls which set the OS scheduling priority were
       disabled. The effect of this change is minimal, because when it is run
       from the SPEC harness, the GROMACS line option '-nice 0' is included,
       which also disables these system calls. For V1.0, a user studying
       435.gromacs outside the runspec harness might have encountered
       inconsistent measurements if '-nice 0' was not used.

     * Replaced a GPL version of the C99 math function "erfc" with a public
       domain version.

     * Added a new portability flag '-DSPEC_CPU_HAVE_ERF' which can be set to
       cause use of a system's "erfc" library function instead of the version
       included with the benchmark. This flag is the default on some
       platforms.
