Benchmark Description

   Tonto^[1]1 is an open source quantum chemistry package, designed by Dylan
   Jayatilaka and Daniel J. Grimwood. Objectives include simplicity and
   portability; aspects not seen in many quantum chemistry codes. The code is
   easily extendable by chemists with limited programming skills and time,
   and is easy to understand and use^[2]2.

   Tonto is written within an object oriented design, in Fortran 95. It uses
   derived types and modules to represent classes. Classes range from
   integers and text files, through to atoms, spacegroups and molecules.
   There is a "self" variable in most routines, which should be familiar from
   many OO languages. Tonto uses dynamic memory instead of common blocks, and
   uses array operations where possible.

   The profiles of Tonto calculations are typical of many ab initio quantum
   chemistry packages. That is, a large portion is dedicated to the
   evaluation of integrals between products of Gaussian basis functions.

   The SPEC reference calculation is in the field of quantum crystallography.
   It places a constraint on a molecular Hartree-Fock wavefunction
   calculation to better match experimental X-ray diffraction data^[3]3. It
   is expected that other similar properties calculated from the constrained
   wavefunction should also agree better with experiment.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   The input file contains the crystal structure, atom positions, and basis
   functions, and experimental X-ray diffraction data. It then gives
   calculation parameters, and does the calculation. The crystal structure,
   atom positions, and X-ray data are from the literature^[4]4.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The main output file is regularly updated to show how far the calculation
   is from the final answer. Once the final model wavefunction is obtained,
   the X-ray diffraction data calculated from it are printed out together
   with the experimental data and compared. The chi^2 of one means the
   calculated and experimental data sets agree to within experimental
   accuracy.

   The coefficients for the wavefunction are stored in the file
   "n2o4.molecular_orbitals,restricted,ascii". Although not done so in the
   465.tonto reference calculation, this data can then be used to calculate
   other properties of the system, such as the Electron Localisation Function
   or the electrostatic potential^[5]5.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   Fortran 95

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

   Tonto makes extensive use of new features added to the Fortran language
   with the Fortran 90/95 standards (such as generic interfaces and vector
   subscripts). Some older compilers may not have complete support for these
   features; therefore, users may wish to obtain the most recent update of
   their compiler before trying Tonto.
