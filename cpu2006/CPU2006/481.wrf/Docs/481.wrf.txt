                       SPEC CPU2006 Benchmark Description

Benchmark Name

   481.wrf

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark Author

   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in collaboration with
   multiple government agencies, universities, and others.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark Program General Category

   Weather Forecasting

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benchmark Description

   481.wrf is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model,
   which is a next-generation mesocale numerical weather prediction system
   designed to serve both operational forecasting and atmospheric research
   needs.

   WRF features multiple dynamical cores, a 3-dimensional variational (3DVAR)
   data assimilation system, and a software architecture allowing for
   computational parallelism and system extensibility. The parallel portions
   of the code have been turned off for SPEC CPU2006 as the interest here is
   in single processor performance.

   WRF is suitable for a broad spectrum of applications across scales ranging
   from meters to thousands of kilometers.

   WRF version 2.0.2 is used in the benchmark version, 481.wrf.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   The WRF Standard Initialization (SI) software is used to create the data
   sets. The June 2001 SI data archived at NCAR is used as data sets. The
   data is 10 km from 1200 UTC June 11 - 1200 UTC Jun 12 2001 at 3 h
   interval.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The temperature at a certain grid point is printed for every time step and
   validated.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   Fortran 90 and C

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

   481.wrf requires the netCDF library for I/O. netCDF is packaged as part of
   the source, but may need to be configured for your system. SPEC_CPU
   portability options are provided.

   481.wrf uses unformatted I/O to read its data files. By default, files
   with 4-byte headers will be read. If your system requires 8-byte headers,
   please set

   wrf_data_header_size = 8

   in the 481.wrf section of your config file.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portability issues fixed subsequent to the release of SPEC CPU2006 V1.0

     * New with CPU2006 V1.1, added new portability flag -DSPEC_CPU_NEED_IO_H
       to include the header file io.h on Windows. Previously, io.h was only
       included if _MSC_VER was defined by the compiler.
     * New with CPU2006 V1.1, fixed a Fortran 90 standards violation where
       two associated dummy arguments were defined during the execution of a
       subprogram. Note that this update used the same fix as WRF version
       2.2. (481.wrf is based on WRF version 2.1).

       In a bit more detail: There is a subroutine in module_bl_ysu.F90 that
       is called in violation of the Fortran standard about variable
       overlapping. The routine tridin has three variables (cu,r1,r2) that
       are passed in the same parameters as (au,a1,a2) in both calls. The new
       code has fixed this problem by making copies of the read-only versions
       of the duplicated parameters before the call.
